# Welcome to Carbon Footprint Counter (Web)!

## Inspiration 
I got this idea after seeing the state of our world and the environment. Global warming is increasing, and we need to play our part. After looking at certain trends with people since the Industrial Revolution, it becomes clear that we are not really aware of how much of a carbon footprint we have. 

This is why this website was created, in order to serve this purpose of recording down how much of a carbon footprint we have, so that we are more aware of it. This is designed with the vision in mind for more people to be aware of their carbon footprint, how it affects the Earth and how to reduce it.

This web idea was actually derived from my app CarbonFootCounter, where I integrated similar features from that Swift App into this website. (https://github.com/DWizard11/CarbonFootCounter)

## Process of App
This is a website designed for users to record down their actions which has carbon footprint and give recommendations on how to reduce thier carbon footprint daily. 

## How was it built? 
I used the Flask module here for the website, along with some HTML, CSS and JS. I had also used hash encryption, in order to encrpyt the passwords for account storing. I had used also SQLite3 to store data inside. This is all created with the Replit IDE. The website, is hosted by PythonAnywhere.

## Challenges 
The MAIN MAIN challenge was trying to upload this to the web, as there were many erorrs and missing dependecies, took about 2+ hrs. The other main challenge for this app was actually the managing of the accouts. 

## Accomplishments: 
I am very proud I stayed on until 3am in order to launch this website for my dear Computing Teacher, and I am quite proud how I still stayed on and not gave up despite the numerous and irritating errors I got from the bash. I am also proud for taking up this challenge and it was indeed very fun and I would love to do it again. 

## What I learned: 
I learnt that there is so much more to Flask, such as session and also learnt a lot more about account creation and encryption. Overall, very fun!!

## What's next for Carbon Footprint Counter?
First, I intend to put in a AI that can help in giving more personalised tips in reducing carbon footprint, and also integrating a carbon footprint calculator for ease of access.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy!
